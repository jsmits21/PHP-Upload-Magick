An object-based class for the easy uploading and manipulation of files. PHP Upload Magick can easily upload and rename files, resize and sharpen images, and just generally make handling uploads on your web server pain free. Also included are all the necessary files for uploading multiple files in one form using SWF Upload.

2: The 'website' folder would be your website's domain folder. Ex: 'mywebsite.com'. Simply copy the contents of this folder to your websites domain folder.
3: All paths in the contained files are relative, and should work without much, if any modification. If you want your directory tree to differ from my own, you must change the paths in the contained files.
